# CS-300

## What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
In the projects for this course, I:
- Applied non-coding development methodologies for outlining an algorithmic design
- Evaluated complex data structures that solve a given problem using advanced algorithmic designs
- Developed code using algorithms and data structures to solve basic programming problems

## How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I wrote pseudocode for different data structures (vector, hash table, and tree) to address each of the problem's solution requirements. I performed a runtime analysis to determine which data structure would be the best for coding the project. Then, I completed code that addressed all of the projects requirements.

## How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
Some of the roadblocks that I encountered were the normal programming issues that I typically resolve with Google or the help of a tutor. 

## How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
The work on this project had me researching multiple data structures before choosing one to implement in my code design. It also had me write pseudocode for the project before coding, which I don't normally do. I think these assignments helped me in the pre-coding planning process, and I think I will be using that approach in the future.

## How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I think that the work on this project emphasized commenting out the code piece-by-piece, which is a huge help in being able to change code later on.
